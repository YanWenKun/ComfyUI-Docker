# MEGAPAK image for ComfyUI

**MEGAPAK** uses the same base mechanism as the `slim` images. The key differences are:

* Includes 40+ custom nodes. See link:./builder-scripts/preload-cache.sh[the full list].
* Includes CUDA development kit for compiling PyTorch C++ extensions, `.cu` files, etc.
* Includes performance optimization libraries such as Nunchaku and SageAttention (powerful but may have compatibility issues).
* Includes additional tools and dependencies.
* As a result, the image is larger and receives updates later than the `slim` images, especially during PyTorch version changes, since some packages are specific to particular PyTorch versions.


## Usage

Please successfully run the `slim` image before attempting the `megapak` image. The prerequisites/setup sections are omitted from this document.

## CLI_ARGS Reference

[%autowidth,cols=2]
|===
|args |description

|--disable-xformers
|Disable xFormers. Enabling xFormers can cause 
https://github.com/YanWenKun/ComfyUI-Docker/issues/128[issues] 
on Blackwell GPUs, but may be required for some video workflows (e.g. SVD).

|--use-pytorch-cross-attention
|Works the same as `--disable-xformers` for NVIDIA GPUs.

|--fast
|Enable experimental optimizations.
(e.g. 
https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI/commit/9953f22fce0ba899da0676a0b374e5d1f72bf259[float8_e4m3fn] 
matrix multiplication on Ada Lovelace and later GPUs).
Might lower image quality. +
Turn it off if you want stability over speed.

|--disable-smart-memory
|Force ComfyUI to offload models from VRAM to RAM more frequently. Slows performance but reduce memory leaks.

|--lowvram
|Force ComfyUI to split the model (UNET) into parts to use less VRAM, at the cost of speed. Use only if your GPU has less than 6 GB of VRAM.

|--novram
|Use system RAM only, no VRAM at all. Very slow.

|--cpu
|Run on CPU. Very slow. Used for testing purposes.

|PIP_INDEX_URL
|'https://pypi.org/simple'
|Set mirror site for Python Package Index.

|HF_ENDPOINT
|'https://huggingface.co'
|Set mirror site for HuggingFace Hub.

|HF_TOKEN

|HF_HUB_ENABLE_HF_TRANSFER
|1
|Enable HuggingFace Hub experimental high-speed file transfers.
Only make sense if you have >1Gbps and VERY STABLE connection (e.g. cloud server).

|Build target for PyTorch and its extensions.
For most users, no setup is needed as it will be automatically selected on Linux.
When needed, you only need to set one build target just for your GPU.
