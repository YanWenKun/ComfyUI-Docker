# Docker images for ComfyUI

*link:README.zh.adoc[＞💡中文说明点我💡＜]*

This repo is for 
https://hub.docker.com/r/yanwk/comfyui-boot[Docker images] 
that runs 
https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI[ComfyUI] - 
a Stable Diffusion GUI powering node-based workflow.

## Quick Start - NVIDIA GPU

### From Maxwell (GTX 9xx) to Ada Lovelace (RTX 40xx)

```sh
mkdir -p storage

docker run -it --rm \
  --name comfyui-cu126 \
  --gpus all \
  -p 8188:8188 \
  -v "$(pwd)"/storage:/root \
  -e CLI_ARGS="" \
  yanwk/comfyui-boot:cu126-slim
```

### From Turing (RTX 20xx / GTX 16xx) to Blackwell (RTX 50xx)

```sh
mkdir -p storage

docker run -it --rm \
  --name comfyui-cu128 \
  --gpus all \
  -p 8188:8188 \
  -v "$(pwd)"/storage:/root \
  -e CLI_ARGS="--fast" \
  yanwk/comfyui-boot:cu128-slim
```


## More image tags

Note: This repository is currently under heavy development.
The next two mainly supported image families will be `cu126` and `cu129`.

`cu121` and `cu124` images will be archived soon, as they are no longer supported by PyTorch.

`cu118` will stay for a while for compatibility usage (such as classic SD 1.5 on older hardware), but will not receive any updates.

`cu128` will stop updating after `cu129` is released.

* link:cu121/README.adoc[`cu121`]

** Easy for ComfyUI beginners. Starts with ComfyUI, ComfyUI-Manager and the Photon (SD1.5) model.
** Using a low-privilege user within the container (easy for WSL2 deploy).
** Not recommended for Podman or rootless deploy (use any image below instead).
** Using CUDA 12.1 + Python 3.11.

* link:cu124-slim/README.adoc[`cu124-slim`]

** Similar to `cu121`, equipped with many dependencies, starts with ComfyUI and ComfyUI-Manager only.
** Downloads less. No SD model included.
** Using 'root' user within the container (easy for rootless deploy).
** Using CUDA 12.4 + Python 3.12.

** All-in-one bundle, including dev kits.
** Using CUDA 12.1 + Python 3.11.
